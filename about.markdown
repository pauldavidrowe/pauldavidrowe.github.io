Welcome to my personal site. There's not much going on here since it's main purpose is to host my publication list with links to preprints.

I do research in formal methods for computer security. If you don't know what that means, I've taken to calling myself an applied logician. Basically, I create and work with logical models of computing systems and prove theorems about those models. The more accurately the models represent the real systems, the more meaningful those theorems are. Since graduating with my PhD in mathematics from University of Pennsylvania I have worked at The MITRE Corporation. All views posted here are my own.
